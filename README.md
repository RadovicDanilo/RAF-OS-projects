# OS Projects

Projects completed as part of an operating systems course at RAF.

## hw1 - Command History

An extension for the xv6 operating system that adds a command history feature. The command history has a maximum length of 3 by default, but this can be modified to accommodate a longer history. Users can navigate through the command history using the Shift + Up (`⇧↑`) and Shift + Down (`⇧↓`) arrow keys.

## hw2 - Symbolic Links and Disk Usage

An extension for the xv6 operating system that adds support for symbolic links and a command to view the disk usage of any file.

## hw3 - Shared Memory Object

An extension for the xv6 operating system that adds shared memory objects, allowing multiple processes to share the same memory.

## hw4 - Multi-Threaded Trie Autocomplete

A program written in C. Users can add multiple directories, each scanned by a different thread. New words are continually added to the trie structure. When a user enters a word, the program lists all words with the same prefix. If a word is added to the trie structure, it will be immediately displayed to the user.
